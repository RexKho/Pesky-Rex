# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.

# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor

#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'



# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/config/master.key
